# HP-Pavilion-Wifi-driver-issue

Firstly you can dowload the latest Linux firmware from this URL (http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/)

for example:

  `wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_1.201_all.deb`

then

you can install the downloaded package using this command:

  `sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb`
  
finally you can `reboot` and Wifi driver is ready to use now.
